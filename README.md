# Refund Eligibility

This little repo is my solution to the challenge. I converted the data to a JSON file (in `src/data/reversals.json`) and the main data processing logic is in `src/lib/service.ts`.

## Running the app

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Running the tests

```bash
npm run test
```
